# Angular-Ecommerce-Backend-.NET
This is the backend of my Angular project using ASP.NET Core Project.
  
The Angular frontend works independently from this Backend but is compatible, as I wanted people to be able to just download the front and the app to work with just that.
  
I have no idea about how cybersecurity works, and so I don't think any of the daty is encrypted as i was able to intercept them with Postman.
  
It works using ASP.NET Core project, WEBAPI, and SQL Server Management Studio 21.
  
I plan on making this compatible with MySQL to beguin with, and then Azure/AWS.
I found this relatively easy, following the tutorial, since I already have basis in C# and the little XML i had to edit was relatively simple.
